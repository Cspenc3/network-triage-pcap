# Network Triage (PCAP/Zeek)

This repo contains **network traffic captures, analysis notes, and cheatsheets** created while studying **Computer Networking (CYB 210, SNHU)**.  
The goal is to build hands-on skills in **traffic analysis, anomaly detection, and incident response**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Contents
- **PCAPs** â€“ Sample packet captures from Wireshark/Zeek labs.  
- **Analysis Notes** â€“ Writeups on normal vs. suspicious traffic patterns.  
- **Cheatsheets** â€“ Networking study guides (OSI vs TCP/IP, protocols, subnetting).  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Build comfort with Wireshark and Zeek for packet analysis.  
- Document normal vs. abnormal traffic behavior.  
- Practice mapping suspicious traffic to **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**.  
- Strengthen networking fundamentals for **Incident Response and Security Architecture**.
